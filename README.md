Students for the Exploration and Development of Space (SEDS) is a dynamic student organization at Florida International Universityâ€™s College of Computing and Engineering. Founded in 2022, our club is dedicated to advancing the engineering design process of rockets, fostering innovation, and encouraging hands-on learning in the field of aerospace engineering.

What began as a small team of three passionate individuals has since grown into a vibrant community of students collaborating across various subteams. Our primary goal is to participate in the Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition (IREC), where we design, build, and launch rockets to push the boundaries of space exploration and technology.

At SEDS, we provide an inclusive environment where students from diverse backgrounds can learn, experiment, and contribute to rocketry projects, developing both technical and leadership skills that are crucial for future careers in aerospace and engineering.
